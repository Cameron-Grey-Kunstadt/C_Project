This file will document some of the important things that I learned with regards to software development in C.

Walkthrough: The walkthrough that I followed for developing this game is Dan Zaidan's "Making a game in C from scratch". 

Text Editor: Dan uses 4coder in his tutorials so thats what I used as well for simplicity.

Setting up 4 coder requires a 4coder project file, a bat file, a run file, and all of your actual program files. The project file just shows details about the project, as well as shortcuts and commands you can specify for your project. The bat file gives build and compile instructions, and the run file just runs the executable. These two files allow you to specify and give shortcuts to the terminal commands you would otherwise have to run everytime.

The compiler: The compiler used here is gcc. Dan actually uses cl, which I think comes from VisualStudio, but it seems like gcc is equally or more popular for c compiling. I downloaded the minGW x64 file for my machine and added the path.
