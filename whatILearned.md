# Intro, motivations, and materials

This file will document some of the important things that I learned with regards to developing software in C. I will be making a demo of a basic game in order to learn some of the standard methods of programming a windows application in C. This motivation for this is to have an example project of C to show in interviews and on github.

#### Walkthroughs 
The walkthroughs that I followed for developing this game were Dan Zaidan's "Making a game in C from scratch" on youtube, as well as Molly Rocket's Handmade Hero
"Intro to C on Windows" series. The Handmade Hero series is a detailed and very beginner-friendly introduction to C programming, Dan Zaidan's series is much faster paced, and gets into game development very quickly, so knowing some C programming going into it is helpful.
        
#### Books
"The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is an excellent text to have for learning C. The examples and practice exercises are very good, and the book is very information dense. Its pretty dry as it is a textbook, and definitely treats you as a reader that's already a proficient programmer.
      

# Tools

Text Editor: Dan uses 4coder in his tutorials so thats what I used as well for simplicity.

Setting up 4 coder requires a 4coder project file, a bat file, a run file, and all of your actual program files. The project file just shows details about the project, as well as shortcuts and commands you can specify for your project. The bat file gives build and compile instructions, and the run file just runs the executable. These two files allow you to specify and give shortcuts to the terminal commands you would otherwise have to run everytime.

The compiler: The compiler used here is gcc. Dan actually uses cl, which I think comes from VisualStudio, but it seems like gcc is equally or more popular for c compiling. I downloaded the minGW x64 file for my machine and added the path.
